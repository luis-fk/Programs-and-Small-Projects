##Word Count
#### This program reads a text from a file, puts all its words into a binary tree,
   keeps the frequency of how often each word appears on the text, and then organizes
   the words into an array of linked lists where the index is the frequency in which 
   that specif word appears in the text
   
   the program reads a file whose name must be given as a command line argument and the text
   must be ASCII compatible, so Enlish text is preferred.
   
   An example of a file that can be used it provided.
